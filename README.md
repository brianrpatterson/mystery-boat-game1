# Mystery Boat Game
An extremely basic murder mystery text adventure game

I created this at HackUSU 2026 in an effort to learn more about classes and functions

**HackUSU1.py** is the file as shown in the demo video.

**Mystery Boat Game.py** is the same file with colored text removed so it can be run without installation of termcolor.
